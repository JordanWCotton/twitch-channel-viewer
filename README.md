# twitch-channel-viewer
This app utilizes Twitch's API for pulling channel and user data to be displayed to the user. The user is able to search for a specific twitch user to be displayed in their list, and they will be able to see the online status of each user. If the user is online, they will be able to see the title of their current stream, and will be given a link to be taken directly to that user's live stream. The user can select to view only online streamers, or to view all streamers on their list. If the user inputs a user that does not exist or who's account is no longer active, they will be informed and no action will be taken. 

This application is hosted on Heroku, and is available at https://github.com/Sophmod/twitch-channel-viewer.

# Development info
This application is developed using vanilla ES2015 javascript, to maximize the learning of fundamental tasks like making AJAX requests, handling JSON, and manipulating the DOM without the ease of a libraries assistance.
